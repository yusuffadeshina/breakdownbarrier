		<h2>Muna Shafie</h2>
		<p>
			I have been in the field of education since 2014, beginning my career in primary and secondary schools, where I focused on inclusion and supported children and young people at risk of exclusion. This experience ignited my passion for continuing my career in education, particularly in helping the most vulnerable children transition through their educational journeys and providing them with the necessary support. I hold diplomas in Education, a teaching degree, and certifications in Mental and Emotional Health, Attachment, Trauma, and CELTA. In 2017, I transitioned to Further Education and have since been working as a lecturer. My role includes delivering a 12-week course for young people who are NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) in Bristol. Beyond teaching, I am committed to understanding the diverse needs of my students, ensuring they receive the support necessary to overcome the barriers they face. I organise and deliver various workshops centred around personal development, giving young people the opportunity to explore different paths and enhance their skills. A significant part of my course focuses on employability, where I conduct workshops on the importance of employability skills and guide young people in further developing in this area. My goal is to help them unlock their potential and broaden their options, whether that involves personal development, employment, apprenticeships, further courses, or university. I am deeply passionate about what I do and feel privileged to support individuals at different stages of their journeys. Helping them realise their potential and make a positive impact on the world is incredibly rewarding, and I am dedicated to continuing this vital work.
